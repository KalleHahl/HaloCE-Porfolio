          Driven and compassionate 24-year-old computer science student from
          Helsinki, with a strong passion for technology and a keen interest in
          problem-solving. I am currently pursuing my degree in computer science
          at the University of Helsinki, where I've had the opportunity to delve
          into various aspects of software development and programming. I
          consider social skills one of my strongest assets, and I thrive in a
          teamwork setting. Throughout both my academic and professional
          journeys, I've gained experience working in groups with people from
          diverse backgrounds. As an avid film and music enthusiast, I enjoy
          exploring new music genres and attending film festivals. In the
          future, I hope to find a way to combine my passion for technology with
          my love for music and cinema.
