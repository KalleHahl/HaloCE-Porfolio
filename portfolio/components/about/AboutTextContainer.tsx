        Driven and compassionate 24-year-old computer science student from
        Helsinki, with a strong passion for technology and a keen interest in
        problem-solving. I am currently pursuing my degree in computer science
        at the University of Helsinki, where I've had the opportunity to delve
        into various aspects of software development and programming. I consider
        social skills one of my strongest assets, and I thrive in a teamwork
        setting. Throughout both my academic and professional journeys, I've
        gained experience working in groups with people from diverse
        backgrounds. As an avid film and music enthusiast, I enjoy exploring new
        music genres and attending film festivals. In the future, I hope to find
        a way to combine my passion for technology with my love for music and
        cinema.Driven and compassionate 24-year-old computer science student
